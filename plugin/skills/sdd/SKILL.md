description: NexusMind SDD artifact protocol — how agents save, read, version and link the documents of a spec-driven change (proposal, spec, design, tasks, verify-report). Triggers when running any SDD phase, reading a prior phase's artifact, resuming a change after compaction or on a fresh machine, checking what changes are in flight, or any question about save_sdd_artifact / get_sdd_artifact / the `nexusmind` persistence mode. Encodes the dual-persistence contract and the both-writes-or-fail rule that the individual MCP tool descriptions cannot convey on their own.

# NexusMind SDD Artifacts — Persistence Protocol

You have NexusMind **SDD artifact** tools available. An *SDD change* is one `openspec/changes/{name}/` folder: a proposal, its delta specs, a design, a task list, and the reports the phases produce. This skill is how those documents are persisted, read back, and linked.

This is the **artifact protocol**, not the phase workflow. The `sdd-*` phase skills (`sdd-propose`, `sdd-design`, `sdd-tasks`, …) are a separate **harness**, installed from the harness library — they decide *what* to write. This skill decides *where it goes and how it comes back*.

## SDD is OpenSpec. The files are the convention.

An SDD artifact is not a free-form document you invent a home for. It is **a file at a defined path in the `openspec/` tree**, and the store mirrors that tree exactly. Get the path wrong and the store and the filesystem stop describing the same thing.

```
openspec/
├── config.yaml                    <- project SDD config (artifact_store: nexusmind)
├── specs/                         <- THE SOURCE OF TRUTH: the living specification.
│   └── {capability}/spec.md          sdd-archive merges each change's deltas into here.
└── changes/
    ├── archive/                   <- completed changes, folder named YYYY-MM-DD-{change-name}
    └── {change-name}/             <- one in-flight change
        ├── proposal.md
        ├── specs/{capability}/spec.md   <- DELTA specs (ADDED / MODIFIED / REMOVED / RENAMED)
        ├── design.md
        ├── tasks.md
        ├── exploration.md         <- optional
        ├── apply-progress.md
        ├── verify-report.md
        ├── archive-report.md
        └── state.yaml
```

The `kind` you pass to `save_sdd_artifact` is the **filename stem** of that file. They are the same fact, expressed twice:

| `kind` | File |
|---|---|
| `proposal` | `proposal.md` |
| `spec` | `specs/{capability}/spec.md` — **pass `capability`** |
| `design` | `design.md` |
| `tasks` | `tasks.md` |
| `exploration` | `exploration.md` |
| `apply-progress` | `apply-progress.md` |
| `verify-report` | `verify-report.md` |
| `archive-report` | `archive-report.md` |
| `state` | `state.yaml` |

Three are **hyphenated**, not snake_case. `apply_progress` is rejected — the DB and the filesystem must agree about the identity of the same document.

Always pass `path`: the repo-relative path of the file you just wrote. It is what lets a reader get from the store back to the file.

**A delta spec goes under `specs/{capability}/`, never at the change root.** Some older changes in the wild put a bare `spec.md` beside `proposal.md`. The store tolerates it (it lands with an empty capability) but **do not reproduce it** — a change with three capabilities writes three files and makes three `save_sdd_artifact` calls. `spec` is the only kind that repeats within a change.

> **Not modelled yet:** `openspec/specs/{capability}/spec.md` — the *main* specs, the source of truth that `sdd-archive` merges deltas into. The store covers `openspec/changes/**` only. Keep writing those files as the convention says; do **not** try to smuggle them in under another kind.

## The one rule that governs everything

**Both writes succeed, or the phase fails loudly.**

An artifact lives in two places on purpose:

| | git (`openspec/`) | NexusMind |
|---|---|---|
| authoritative for | the reviewable text, in a PR, on a branch | the queryable, linkable, cross-session record |
| gives you | diff review, blame, offline, rollback | search, the admin UI, task/sprint/memory links, recovery after compaction |

Neither is a cache of the other. Write the file **and** call `save_sdd_artifact`. If either leg fails, the phase is **FAILED** — not "partially done". Silent degradation to single persistence is the exact failure this whole system exists to prevent: it is how you end up with a design document that exists on one laptop and nowhere else.

## Tools at a glance

| Tool | When |
|------|------|
| `save_sdd_artifact` | After writing any artifact file. Every phase, every time. |
| `get_sdd_artifact` | Before a phase that depends on an earlier one. **This is the cross-phase read.** |
| `get_sdd_change` | Resuming a change — the artifact inventory *is* the recoverable state. |
| `list_sdd_changes` | "What's in flight?" — powers `/sdd-status`. |
| `update_sdd_change` | Phase and status transitions. |
| `search_sdd_artifacts` | "Which spec covers rate limiting?" — full-text, across every change in the org. |
| `link_sdd_change_memory` | Tie a decision or bugfix back to the change that produced it. |

## Saving (`save_sdd_artifact`)

Call it **unconditionally**, after every artifact write. Do **not** add a "did the content change?" guard — the backend already de-duplicates by content hash: re-saving identical content creates **no revision**, touches no index, and does not bump any timestamp. Your defensive check would be dead code that can only introduce bugs.

Required: `project`, `change_name`, `kind`, `content`. Strongly recommended: `path` (the repo-relative file path, so the store knows where the file lives).

See the table above for the `kind` → file mapping. Pass `capability` for `spec`, and only for `spec`.

**Re-running a phase appends a revision; it never overwrites.** Content A → B → A appends *revision 3* — a revert is an event and belongs in the history. There is no way to lose an earlier version.

## Reading (`get_sdd_artifact`) — the part that matters

When a phase depends on an earlier one, fetch it with `get_sdd_artifact`. It returns the **complete document**.

This is the whole point of the tool. Do **not** reach for `search_memory` to recover an artifact: memory search returns a *truncated preview*, and a design document is tens of kilobytes. A phase that plans against a truncated design plans against a document it has not read.

A missing artifact reports **not-found** — never an empty string. `Ok(None)` means *"there is no design yet"*, which is different from *"the design is empty"*. If a required dependency is absent, **stop and report blocked**. Do not proceed on a blank document.

## Resuming (`get_sdd_change`)

After a compaction, on a fresh machine, or with no checkout at all: `get_sdd_change` returns the change with its full artifact inventory. **That inventory is the state.** You do not need `state.yaml`, and you do not need the repo — you can tell exactly which phases have run by which artifacts exist.

## Phase transitions (`update_sdd_change`)

Phase is **advisory metadata**, not a write gate. Saving a `verify-report` to a change still in `propose` is accepted — the artifact inventory is the ground truth, and out-of-order work is legitimate. But keep the record honest: advance the phase explicitly with `update_sdd_change`.

`update_sdd_change` takes a **change id**, not a name. Resolve it first (`get_sdd_change` / `list_sdd_changes`), then transition. Never encode state by editing an artifact's content.

Phases: `explore → propose → spec → design → tasks → apply → verify → archive`.
Statuses: `active | archived | abandoned`.

## Linking

- `link_sdd_change_memory` — when a phase records a decision or a bugfix, link it to the change. Idempotent; re-linking with a different `relation` (`produced` / `informed`) updates it, so call it freely.
- Tasks link to changes by **name**, through the existing `link_task_spec` tool (see the `nexusmind-tasks` skill). A change and its tasks find each other through that name — there is no second foreign key to maintain.

## Gotchas

- **The 1 MB cap is atomic.** An oversized `content` is rejected with 422 and leaves *no* change, *no* artifact and *no* revision behind. It does not half-create anything.
- **Content is never returned by list endpoints.** `list_sdd_changes` and the revision list carry metadata only. Ask for content per artifact or per revision.
- **Artifacts are read-only from the admin UI.** The admin curates (phase, status, sprint, memory links); it never authors artifact content. You and git are the only writers.
- **An archived change is still a valid link target.** Archiving hides a change from the default list; it does not withdraw its artifacts or break its task links.
